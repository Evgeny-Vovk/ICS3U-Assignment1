1)   ILOVEYOU type is worm.


2. Define what the particular malware is.
2)  ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love Letter for you,
    is a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000.


3. How can you get it? 
3)   It started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs.",
    saying “I love you and I want you to read this message,” after downloading the file,
     the virus would clone itself and send new mails the same way to other people, this way it spread up to ten millions windows computers.


4. What can it do to your computer?
4)   When the affected user opens the attachment,
     their action instantly downloads the worm into their system without their knowledge and starts spreading it across the network,
     what it does to your is it’s deleting your files,
     replacing them and making a mess in your storage while making thousands of copies of the virus so it makes it hard to delete the virus back then.


5. How do you prevent it from happening?
5)   Now the virus is gone, but back then, there were not many antiviruses or something that could help you prevent it,
     the only way to prevent it was not to download the file sent in the mail.
